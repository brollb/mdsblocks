# Blockly-Concepts
This contains my blockly-concepts integration for metamds

# Project structure:
    + concepts/
        + Block definitions
    + code/
        + Instances of simulations, etc
    + project.yaml

## Building (for use as IPython extensions)
+ Install node and npm (sudo port install nodejs; sudo port install npm)
+ Install uglifyjs and uglifycss (sudo npm install uglifyjs -g; sudo npm install uglifycss -g)

## To Do:
+ Set up travis ci
    + Add more tests

+ Remove cdn dependency

+ Duplicate workspaces on opening a new thing
    + 

+ I think there is a bug in octokat
    + I think it is doing unauthenticated reads to github... (these are limited)
